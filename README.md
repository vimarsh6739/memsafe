# Memsafe
Memsafe is an attempt to implement some commonly used data structures in C++, in a memory safe pattern. My basic idea is to use smart pointers, and exploit RAII as much as possible.

## data structures
The inital plan is to implement the following data structures.

| Type| Data Structure| Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| List Based | Singly Linked List | Pending |
| | Doubly Linked List | Pending |
| Tree Based | Binary Tree | Pending |
| | AVL Trees | Pending |
| | Red Black Trees| Pending| 
| | B-Trees| Pending | 

## note
The purpose of this repo is a purely intellectual excercise. If you are looking for fast and memory-safe data structures, you are better off looking at standard C++ libraries like [Boost](https://www.boost.org/).
